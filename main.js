<p>"Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.</p>

<p>"<span class="word" title="id: answer">${answer}</span>," replied the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span>, "${conjunction} I get there <span class="word" title="id: speed">${speed}</span> than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."</p>

<p>The <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> was much <span class="word" title="id: adj-1">${adj1}</span> at the idea of running a race with the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span>, but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So the <span class="word" title="id: animal-3">${thirdAnimal}</span>, who had consented to act as judge, marked the distance yelled, "<span class="word" title="id: quote">${quote}</span>".</p>

<p>The <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> was soon far out of sight, and to make the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him to try a race with a <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span>, he went off the course to practice <span class="word" title="id: verb-1">${verb1}</span> for <span class="word" title="id: num-1">${num1}</span> hours until the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> should catch up.</p>

<p>The <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and, after a time, passed the place where the <span class="word" title="animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> was <span class="word" title="id: verb-1">${verb1}</span>. The <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> was so caught up in <span class="word" title="id: verb-1">${verb1}</span>; and when at last he did stop, the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> was near the goal. The <span class="word" title="id: animal-1">${firstAnimal}</span> now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the <span class="word" title="id: animal-2">${secondAnimal}</span> in time.</p>`;
